            <p>Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with Microsoft-specific customazatoins released under a traditional Microsoft product lisence.</p>
            
            <p>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and underdtanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.</p>
            
            <p>Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code`s website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders build.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For Dev Containers, use the <b><i>Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...</i></b>command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.</li>
                <li>For Codespaces, install the GitHub Codespaces extension in VS Code, and use the <b><i>Codespaces: Create New Codespace command.</i></b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Docker / the Codespace should have at least <b>4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)</b> to run full build. See the development container README for more information.</p>
